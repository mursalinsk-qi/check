**Automated checking of test coverage using github actions(GO)**


***Purpose*** : The main purpose is to perform a **test-driven development** process. 
Software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.


***Test-driven development cycle***
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
4. All tests should now pass
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor
6. Repeat

So, this project is developed to help in the process of test-driven development.
